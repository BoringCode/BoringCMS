# Introducing BoringCMS!
A lightweight CMS created as a fun project by Bradley "BoringCode" Rosenfeld

## A Little Back Story
I (Bradley) am still in high school and I wanted to learn more about creating and manipulating MySQL databases with PHP.
I remember when I first started out I didn't understand how to create templates for a popular CMS/Blogging system, Wordpress. Writing the PHP in my HTML template confused me.

So I have created BoringCMS. It is a selector based content management system with support for plugins.
Yes, it is on the rough side. I'm still learning about what is best practice and what isn't.
My hope is that someone smarter then me can take the idea and code and turn it into something awesome.

## What's coming soon?
Well for one thing detailed documentation. Oh, and cleaner code.
