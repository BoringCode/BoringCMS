# Introducing BoringCMS!
A lightweight CMS created as a fun project by Bradley "BoringCode" Rosenfeld

## A Little Back Story
I wanted to learn more about creating and manipulating MySQL databases with PHP.
I remember when I first started out I didn't understand how to create templates for a popular CMS/Blogging system, Wordpress. Writing the PHP in my HTML template confused me.

So I have created BoringCMS. It is a selector based content management system with support for plugins.
Yes, it is on the rough side. I'm still learning about what is best practice and what isn't.

## What's coming soon?
Well for one thing detailed documentation. Oh, and cleaner code.

## Credits
HTML5/CSS3 Template: Twitter Bootstrap

CSS Selector Engine: phpQuery
